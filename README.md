This is the fourth assignment for the UNC-Charlotte Coding Bootcamp Delivered by UNC Charlotte.

In this assignment, we were required to create a Steven Universe inspired game for web browsers. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

Getting Started
Crystal Collector

Instructions:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals on the page. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
